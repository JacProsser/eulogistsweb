    <p>The Eulogists is a combined effort between 5 musicians. Many of whom run personal YouTube   Channels. They wanted to combine forces to make something great. The Eulogist Channel was born. We all wanted to be like the big YouTube video essay channels. Channels such as Nexpo, Barely Sociable, and blameitonjorge, but with a musical twist. They all had this goal. But individually they could not make it happen. However, when we made a joint effort, we could be more. </p>
    <p> They all for the most part met on Discord through a tech server. Even though they were on a tech server they started talking about their musical interests. The idea was born. At first, they wanted to do a podcast discussing music. However, that idea morphed into an entire YouTube channel. It was just Calvin, Quinn, and Rylan at first. All three from different countries, using discord to chat. After their first 2 video essays they knew they needed more people. It was then they added Fifo.</p>
    <p>Fifo was a wild card in our group. He did many things. Things like help moderate the Eulogists discord. They all had their place in the group contributing equally to help keep the YouTube channel running smoothly.</p>
    <p>After they had decided to stick to a weekly upload schedule, they knew that they had to have weekly filler content to fill the gaps between essays. This is where Tusk comes in. Tusk’s expertise is in music mixing mashups and remixes. He helped to provide. The filler that they needed.</p>
    <p>Now who was going to beef up the Discord and help to shape this awesome website. None other than Mr. Prosser. He is a discord extraordinaire. He helped program almost every bot you see on the discord today.  He was also the leading force behind this website. Even though he is not an official Eulogist he is still a major part of our little world on YouTube.</p>
    <p>The Goal of The Eulogists project is to teach and entertain. We want to teach you about music and how it affects us and builds our world we live in.  We want to entertain you with our mashups and remixes to keep you coming back and keep you engaged. Even though we have a small channel we strive to have the highest quality content. On the Behalf of everyone at The Eulogists, Welcome. </p>
